 * If you ever upload your code to a public Github repo to share with other students or instructors,
 * itâ€™s illegal to include your personal themoviedb.org API key.
 * Please remove it and note in a README where it came from, so someone else trying to run your code
 * can create their own key and will quickly know where to put it.
 * Instructors and code reviewers will expect this behavior for any public Github code.
